        <li>Place eggs in a large saucepan. Cover them with cool water by 1 inch.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with a lid and bring water to a rolling boil over high heat; when the water has reached a boil, reduce heat to medium-high and set the timer for the desired time. Boil for 8 minutes over medium-high heat for perfect hard boiled eggs. </li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a large bowl of ice water and let them cool for a few minutes. Or you can place them under cool running water to stop the cooking. This will also help the eggs peel easily. </li>
        <li>Remove the eggs from the cold water and peel immediately.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle generous amount of black paper</li>
    </ol>
